Introduction to Power BI

Power BI is a Data Visualization and Business Intelligence tool that converts data from different data sources to interactive dashboards and BI reports. Power BI suite provides multiple software, connector, and services - Power BI desktop, Power BI service based on Saas, and mobile Power BI apps available for different platforms. 

Power BI Desktop
Dynamic reports and data models may be made with Power BI Desktop. Power BI is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. It is free to download and not reliant on Microsoft Office. It is enriched with extensive visuals, built-in DAX functions, and numerous libraries. To download the latest version, you can use the following link: " https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/ "

Power BI Desktop can handle multiple tasks, such as −

ETL(Extract, Transform, and Load) processes are implemented.
Fetch the data from numerous sources like Excel, Sharepoint, SQL Server, Azure, etc.
Generating a Data Model.
Examine the compiled data in a table or single report.
Develop a visual with your data in the report and publish the report.

Power BI Service
Power BI Service (Software as a Service - SaaS) is used to develop and publish the reports executed on Microsoft Azure. It can be accessed at the website https://app.powerbi.com

Power BI can be used for multiple tasks such as −

Developing interactive Dashboard
Viewing and modifying reports
Mutual collaboration and report distribution to others
Creation of apps and their subscription from Power BI service
The Power BI mobile app is used to view the reports and dashboards.


Major Components of Power BI

1. Power Query
It is the process of cleansing and transforming data and permits users to access datasets connecting from multiple sources. It is included on the Power BI desktop. Business users may view the data from distinct databases like MySQL, SQL servers, DB2, and many more.

2. Power View
It is a data visualization tool that assists users in developing stunning charts, and colorful maps, that turn data into a story.

3. Power Map
It is a 3D map visualization tool to identify geospatial data on Map visuals. It seamlessly helps organizations to examine the maximum sales production geographically, visualizing the demographic populations of specific regions.

4. Power Pivot
It is a Data Modelling technique that is used to create relationships between datasets. It performs complex computations by utilizing DAX functions.

5. Power Q & A
When dealing with giant datasets, it becomes crucial to get to know the in-depth details of the data. Luckily, it is done through natural language where users may ask questions and obtain the answer through Power Q & A.

Views in Power BI Desktop

Report View
You may add several pages while working on Report View. The bottom line shows three pages and if you are willing to add more pages then click on the + sign. A report must have a minimum single page where frequent visualization of data is achievable by selecting the fields onto the canvas.

Data View
You can traverse, delve into data, and recognize the data structure in the Data View. The simplest way is to load the data first into this tool and then select the Data View icon to inspect the table. Data manipulation like new measures, formatting, summarization, altering data types, and modifying field names can be employed in the Data View. Sorting and Number filters can also be applied to individual fields of the table.

Model View
You can view the relationship between tables, measures, and columns. The simple data model is understandable and easily refreshed by the users. On the other hand, the complex data model is difficult to construct and generalize. It would be recommended to develop the more complicated relationships using the Power query editor to filter the data and reshape the existing model.
